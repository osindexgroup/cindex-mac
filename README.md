# CINDEX for macOS
CINDEX is a software tool for professional indexers, enabling them to produce indexes in a variety of formats.

CINDEX for Mac works on any Mac computer running macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or higher.

## Version 4.3 Changes
1.	Removes Demo and Student versions of Cindex. Only the full version of Cindex is now available.
2.	Removes registration requirement.
3.	Improves performance in checking cross-references via the **Check Indexâ€¦** command.
4.	Corrects problems with version 4.2.5. The release of MacOS 13 (Ventura) resulted in the then-current version of Cindex for Mac (4.1.5) failing to correctly save documents via the **Save To:** command. A Cindex update (to version 4.2.5) corrected some but not all of the problems, and could fail to open previously created index documents. Cindex 4.3 corrects both problems: 
	a.	It fully restores the capabilities of the **Save To:** command, correctly saving all document types.
	b.	If correctly opens documents created by earlier versions of Cindex.
